## Lab Contents
* <b>Lab1: Wall Following</b><br>
Design and implement a wall following system that can navigate around a sequence of
blocks and obstacles that form a wall containing gaps, concave corners, and convex
corners.

* <b>Lab2: Odometry</b><br>
Design and implement an Odometry system that provides a robotâ€™s position and orientation,
allowing it to autonomously navigate a field.

* <b>Lab3: Localization</b><br>
Design a system to localize the robot using ultrasonic and light sensors, where the robot
should move to a known starting position.

* <b>Lab4: Navigation</b><br>
Design a system that allows the robot to drive to a specified set of coordinates, known as waypoints.

* <b>Lab5: Search and Localize</b><br>
Implement a robot with ultrasonic and color sensors for determining the location and color of
a ring without physical contact.
